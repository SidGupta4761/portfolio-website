    <h2 class="sg-section-title">Background</h2>
    <div class="sg-content">
      <p>I’m drawn to engineering because it challenges me to think both practically and creatively, shaping designs that not only work on paper but also perform in the real world. I enjoy working with systems that move, adapt, and interact, where precision and imagination meet to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Mathematics plays an important supporting role, providing a framework to analyze problems and refine ideas.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Just as important to me is the collaborative side of engineering. Leading teams, mentoring peers, and sharing knowledge through outreach have shown me the value of building communities around innovation. Now continuing my path at NC State, I’m excited to keep pushing my technical rigor, creativity, and meaningful impact.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Outside of engineering, I’ve spent over a decade on the tennis court, where competing and captaining my team taught me resilience and adaptability. I also enjoy power sports and anything automotive/racing, which tend to connect back to the same fascination with motion and design that drives my technical work.</p>
