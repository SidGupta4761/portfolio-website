  Co-presented on unique design solutions with two friends from FTC at 2025 Championships
---

During the 2025 FRC World Championships, I had the pleasure to present on unique mechanisms at the FIRST World Championships in Houston. I came as part of FRC Team 900, The Zebracorns, where we finished our season in Daly after a historic season with the team's highest peak EPA in history. I co-presented with Ian Suh and Aaditya Sah from FTC Team 22377, The Sigmacorns, and we enjoyed teaching about our shared interest in innovative design solutions. Here is our presentation:
