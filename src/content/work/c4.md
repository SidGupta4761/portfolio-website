As Design and Mechanical Lead for FRC Team 900, The Zebracorns, I directed the mechanical and CAD divisions during the 2025 build season. The team operated with 25 mechanical members and 5 CAD specialists, and I coordinated subsystem development, prototyping, fabrication, and integration of the 150-lb competition robot. Despite significant mentor and senior team member turnover, the season resulted in the second-highest performance in team history, including a victory at the 2025 FNC District and State Championships, a #2 ranking in North Carolina, and a team-record EPA of 1724.

My contributions included developing the robot’s master geometry, designing drivetrains, elevators, and shooters, and publishing CAD resources for community use. A notable deliverable was a configurable sheet-metal bumper system, which has been adopted by over 100 FRC teams worldwide. I also managed the team’s Onshape enterprise instance and oversaw all public CAD releases. In addition, I presented the robot’s design methodology and subsystem innovations to an audience of 200+ at the 2025 FIRST Championship.

A key subsystem under my responsibility was the elevator assembly, a three-stage linear mechanism with a 36″ stowed height and a 74″ extended reach. The structure employed machined 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, custom Markforged–aluminum hybrid bearing blocks, and COTS hardware. Power transmission was achieved through a compact 3:1 gearbox integrating dual Kraken X60 motors, dual HTD 5 mm belts routed internally, and custom tensioning solutions. The design reduced system thickness from >5.5″ to <4″ while maintaining structural integrity and experienced zero mechanical failures throughout competition.

To improve efficiency and manufacturability, I applied advanced CAD techniques, including FeatureScripts for pulley/gear generation, master sketches for belt routing and geometry control, and surface modeling for structural supports. By substituting CNC-machined tubes with in-house hybrid bearing blocks produced via Markforged 3D printing and waterjet, I achieved a ~40% cost reduction and shortened subsystem lead time by approximately two weeks.

Here are some CAD screenshots and other items from throughout the season:
