  3D printed differential swerve module

Utilizes differential mechanism to dynamically allocate power between azimuth and drive for a technically superior swerve drive. 

Here is a section view that helps show the construction:

This design has been downloaded by over 100 people and counting from [my GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/ftc-differential-swerve-drive-1). 

In the future, I plan to build a drivebase using these modules, using ROS for control and potentially simulate a digital twin for advanced sensing and navigation.
