  Fully configurable two-piece sheet metal bumpers for FRC
---

This post is copied from [the one I published](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/the-zebracorns-behind-the-stripes-design-code-and-build-blog-2023-2024/440094/11?u=theguywhoasked) on my FRC teamâ€™s 2023/2024 build blog on Chief Delphi, and as a result, was designed around the 2024 bumper rules. The wider 2025 rules gave teams more options, though this assembly is still useful for teams looking into sheet metal backing, and can still be used with PE foam or other materials with adapted construction. Some other questions about our bumper construction were also answered in the Chief Delphi thread linked.

This design inspired the development of SWYFT bumpers by SWYFT robotics, which we used in the 2025 season along with over 100 other teams.
