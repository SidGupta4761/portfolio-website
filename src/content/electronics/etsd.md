  Rpi Pico W IoT-enabled soil-monitoring created as part of ETSD 2025 J-term

This project utilized the wifi features of the Raspberry Pi Pico Wireless and the application IFTTT (If This Then That), a no-code automation tool for connecting devices. This automation sends a message to my phone whenever the Pi detects from the soil moisture sensor that the moisture is below a specified threshold. The video shows it repeatedly sending these notifications as the soil moisture is being kept out on the table, in negligible moisture.

Here is the video where I demonstrate the LCD information display and IoT notifications:
