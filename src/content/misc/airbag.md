This is a model of a concept for the 2023-2024 Conrad Challenge involving an array of linear servos attached to the inflator of an airbag, meant to be able to dynamically change the position and angle of the airbag as it is deployed. This is to improve the safety of airbags, as they currently can accidently injure people, but by being able to change the angle at which it is deployed, those effects can be minimized.

The encasing is meant to be a rough model of the steering column, and the yellow part is meant to be a rough model of an inflator. If you want to mess around with the respective extensions of the linear servos, DM me with the email for your Onshape account and I can share the document this project was made in.
